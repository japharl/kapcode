# kapcode

This is the code that I use when I fly my kite and take photos with the reaspberry pi.  Due to power requirements, recommend an a+ or a pi zero variant.  New - added ground control station code, will be adding gps support to remote and other features... at least that is the current plan, depending on time.

Note - non-networked at this time; may be implementing in the future.
