# kapcode

This is the code that I use when I fly my kite and take photos with the reaspberry pi.  

This code is under periodic re-development to address bugs / features.

Due to power requirements, recommend an a+ or a pi zero variant is preferred.
(Note - you may not want to use the sense hat with a pi zero, as the weight is different.  With the new 3 a+, the power requirements has changed, specifically, 3A+ requires 5.1v 2.5amp, which may change power requirements.  Not sure what the optimal version placement is at this time.)
